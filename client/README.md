# Navigation
The ``src`` directory contains the following directories:
- ``app`` which is generated by NextJS
- ``components`` which hosts reusable components
- ``features`` which hosts components that implement a specific feature. Those are typically not reusable or are used in few places only.
- ``hooks`` which hosts custom hooks used in various parts of the project.
- ``styles`` which hosts various SCSS files. They expose classes, variables, and mixins that you can use in components or pages.
