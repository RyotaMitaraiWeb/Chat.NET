# Navigation
This directory contains components that implement more specific features. This could include things like a navigation menu, a card-like component for little content, and similar. These components are typically only usable in specific circumstances and are not meant to be reusable.

Each folder contains the feature component and its supplementary files (stylesheets, types, etc.).
